<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

![A demonstration](images/demo.png)

A while back, I had found a 3D train map of Tokyo, [called MiniTokyo-3D](https://minitokyo3d.com/) and thought it would be a cool idea to replicate it for Melbourne, seeing as VicRoads had recently exposed an API for querying the live data of train positions. So, during UniHack 2022, me and a team of 4 other people came up with a proof of concept: MiniMelbourne!

Right now, you can search for stations, wander around a 3D Melbourne, and view trains gradually move as their positions update now and then.

### Built With

* [React.js](https://reactjs.org/)
* [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/)
* [Mapbox-GL](https://docs.mapbox.com/mapbox-gl-js/api/)
* [deck.gl](https://deck.gl/)

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

If you want to run this locally, clone both the front-end and back-end, then install the required dependencies for both environments. Ideally, set up a virtual environment for the backend, and install the packages locally for the front-end.

### Prerequisites

* npm
  ```sh
  npm install --save
  npm run build
  ```

* backend
    ```sh
    py get_gtfs.py
    py run.py

    ```
